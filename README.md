# College Inquiry Chatbot using Google Cloud Platform (GCP)

# Project Overview

This project aims to develop a College Inquiry Chatbot that responds to common queries from students regarding college details, courses, location, fee structure, and more. The chatbot is built using Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and leverages cloud-based services to provide an interactive experience.

# Technologies Used (GCP Components)

This chatbot is implemented using the following GCP services:

1. IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service): Google Compute Engine (for hosting the backend)
2. PaaS (Platform as a Service): Google App Engine (for web deployment)
3. SaaS (Software as a Service): Google Dialogflow (for chatbot interactions and NLP processing)

# Project Requirements & Implementation

1. Interactive Cloud-Based Chatbot System: 
The chatbot starts by prompting the user to enter:
‚úÖ First Name
‚úÖ Last Name
‚úÖ Email Address

The chatbot collects this information to personalize the interaction.

2. Student Inquiry List:
The chatbot can handle at least four common student queries, such as:
‚ùì "Does the college have a football team?"
‚ùì "Does it offer a Computer Science major?"
‚ùì "What is the in-state tuition?"
‚ùì "Does it provide on-campus housing?"

3. Response to Student Queries:  
The chatbot provides detailed answers to each of the above queries. It uses Dialogflow for NLP processing, ensuring that the chatbot can understand variations of these questions and provide relevant responses.

4. Deployment & Submission:  
The chatbot is deployed on Google Cloud Platform and accessible via the following URL:
